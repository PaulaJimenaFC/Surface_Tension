# Surface_Tension


This repository contains files related to the research conducted with professors Amauri Jardim de Paula and James Moraes de Almeida. The primary file (`Best_regressor_with_PCA.ipynb`) encompasses experiments for predicting the surface tension of hydrocarbons. Four tabular Machine Learning regressors were proposed:

- XGBoost
- Random Forest
- KNN
- Linear Regression
  
The performance of each algorithm is evaluated across four datasets, each showcasing distinct properties of hydrocarbons. These datasets are available in CSV format (`dataset1_tf`, $\dots$) within this repository. The aim of this work is not only to identify the algorithm that delivers the best performance but also to demonstrate which dataset contributes the most information for predicting surface tension.
